This section has all the notebooks needed to preprocess image datasets for training and after training.
To create your own dataset follow the notebooks in order of:
blip2_logo_captioning.ipynb
masspromptgeneration.ipynb
blip_mass_output.ipynb
search_for_images.ipynb

The training of the images post blip could be done cheaply using EveryDream2 trainer with runpod https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream2trainer
Cost of training both my base model and smaller champlain college model was about 25$
